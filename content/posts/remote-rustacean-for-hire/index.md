I wrote in to a job post by a founder that was emphatic about rust, either you
knew or you had a background in optimization and _eagerly_ wanted to learn it. I
wrote them this email:

They were kind enough to get back to me the next day and let me know the
position was closed. Still it got me excited about actually finding a rust job.
The jobs for rust are not abundant. Developer enthusiasm for rust gives me
confidence that jobs will follow; we're just early to the scene.

I put this post together to salvage my attempt to find a job. So if you've got a
remote rust position or know of one, let me know. I'd be happy to chat.
