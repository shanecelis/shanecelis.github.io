This\npost is a more about how I’m doing it. One of the requirements for\ndoing literate programming is support for the #line compiler\ndirective. Typically one sees these in generated source files.\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n    #line 360 \"hello-world.nw\"\n    printf(\"Hello, World!\\n\");\n}\n\nThis tells the compiler to report errors relative to that line in\nhello-world.nw instead of hello-world.c. This is indispensable\nwhen doing literate programming. If one must find the error in the\ngenerated source file then find the error again in the literate\nsource, literate programming becomes too frustrating and cumbersome to\nuse, at least for me.\nI’m using GNU Guile Scheme for my Google Summer of Code project\nEmacsy. Guile doesn’t have built-in support for #line directives. But\nmore importantly it does have support for reader macros.  Reader\nmacros allow you to define your own syntax. Macro is an overloaded\nterm, so let me try to disambiguate it.\n\n\nC Macros allow one to use C Preprocessor cpp as a limited\nmetaprogramming facility, but they are tricky to get right because\nof the language impedance mismatch of C and cpp.\n\n\nLisp macros are an entirely different beast. They allow one to write\ncode that writes code. Whenever you find yourself writing\nboilerplate code a second or third time, a macro is waiting to be\nborn. Macros allow the user to extend the compiler in a principled\nway. Lisp macros work on S-expressions. They provide instructions\nhow to transform a given S-expression to some other S-expression.\n\n\nReader macros, or reader\nextensions,\nare pieces of code that transform some arbitrary stream of\ncharacters into S-expressions. They allow one to express themselves\nin something other than S-expressions. For instance, maybe you want\na hashmap literal in Guile.  You can write a reader macro that makes\nhashes look like your favorite language.\n\n\n(define hash #{a =&gt; 1, b =&gt; 2})\n\nThe above might be translated into something that looks like this:\n(define hash (let ((h (make-hash-table)))\n               (hashq-set! h 'a 1)\n               (hashq-set! h 'b 2)\n              h))\n\nArmed with reader macros, we can extend the syntax of our language.\nOne constraint with reader macros is that it must start with a #\ncharacter, which is good because it lets the reader know that a\nreader macro is in play.  Conveniently the # character as the start\nof reader macros is the same as that typically used for compiler\nderectives.\nImplementing #line as a Reader Macro\nGiven that we can extend the syntax of our language by using a reader\nmacro, it seems like we should be able to write a #line pragma quite\neasily.  Here was my first attempt.\n(read-hash-extend \n #\\l \n (lambda (char port)\n   (let* ((ine (read port))\n          (lineno (read port))\n          (filename (read port)))\n     (if (not (eq? ine 'ine))\n         (error \n          (format \n           #f\n           \"Expected '#line &lt;line-number&gt; &lt;filename&gt;'; got '#~a~a ~a \\\"~a\\\"'.\" \n            char ine lineno filename)))\n     (set-port-filename! port filename)\n     (set-port-line! port lineno)\n     (set-port-column! port 0)\n     \"\")))\n\nSo the following code \n(define (f x)\n#line 314 \"increment-literately.nw\"\n  (+ x 1))\n\nwill turn into\n(define (f x)\n\"\"\n  (+ x 1))\n\nIn this case, that zero-length string won’t cause much of problem, and\nit will work for top-level definitions because the strings will just\nbe ignored, but consider this following bit of code.\n(+ 1\n#line 628 \"incrementally-literate.nw\"\n  2\n  3)\n\nThis bit of code will become (+ 1 \"\" 2 3), which will throw an\nexception and does not preserve the original meaning of the code.\nBasically, we want a reader macro that emits nothing.  We want a\nreader macro whose output is treated like a comment.\nI had hoped that the other commenting facilities in Guile like\nS-expression comments\n(+ 0 #;(+ 1 2) 3) =&gt; 3; or block\ncomments,\ne.g. #| this is a comment |# were implemented as reader extensions.\nHowever, it turns out these are not and could not be implemented as\nreader extensions in Scheme.  Luckily, Guile is Free Software so we\ncan go spelunking and fix it.\nI found them both implemented in libguile/read.c.  The reason we\ncan’t implement these as reader extensions is because whatever the\nreader extension procedure returns is treated as being from (read ...).  So we need some way to tell it that nothing was read.  There\nare many ways to try to represent this.\n\n\nOne could have a sentinel value that is treated as though it were\nnothing, e.g. any reader extension that emits the symbol\n'no-reader-output is one such solution.  But what if the reader\nmacro has output that coincides with the symbol?\n\n\nOne could attach some property to the reader extension procedure to\nsignify that this reader extension emits nothing.  This is how my\npatch is implemented.  The downside of this is that a procedure may\nnot choose to emit or not during its evaluation. As I wrote this\narticle I realized I had missed a really good option.\n\n\nThe question is, what is the best is a way to represent no value or\nnothing in Scheme?  At first I thought, “This was impossible. All\nScheme procedures return some value.  Some return multiple values.”\nThen it hit me, the values procedure can be used to return one,\nmore, or no values.  Sigh.  Well, I guess I ought to change my\npatch.\n\n\n","id":"https://shanecelis.github.io/posts/a-patch-for-literate-programming-with-gnu-guile/","title":"A Patch for Literate Programming with GNU Guile"},"https://shanecelis.github.io/posts/genesis/":{"body":"I made a geeky comic that trades off the\nstory of The Garden of Eden and the Fall of Man.  I do not endeavor to\nexplain that comic here, but it is apparent that the interpretation of\nthe Fall of Man is colored in such a negative light that I feel I must\npresent my own positive interpretation.\n\nThe creation story described in Genesis is often used by Biblical\nFundamentalists to dismiss an alternative story of humanity’s origins\nthat has emerged from the sciences.  Fundamentalists insist that a\nliteral interpretation is the only legitimate interpretation of the\nBible. It’s as though they are committed to the idea that, “God can do\nall things—except use a metaphor.”  Genesis, and The Fall\nspecifically, is done a disservice by these Fundamentalists because\nThe Fall has a beautiful interpretation seen through the lens of\nscience, which speaks well of it. What is a naturalist’s\ninterpretation of Genesis?  It is not a story that details Man’s fall\nfrom grace; it is a narrative for Man’s ascent from merely animals to\nmoral animals.\nThis essay does not imply that the interpretation given here was\nnecessarily intended by the original authors of Genesis.  One might\nask, why consider the interpretation if the authors did not originally\nintend it?  Because texts are mirrors in that they often reveal more\nabout the reader than the original author, and often profitably so.\nConsider the Declaration of Independence.  Its meaning is more\nbeautiful today than when it was written because it had the capacity\nto grow beyond the constraints of its time.  Americans read and revere\n“all men are created equal” in an inclusive sense, not of applying\nexclusively to white males.  It is no injustice that American culture\nand language have grown beyond what Thomas Jefferson and the Second\nContinental Congress had intended.  It is in this sense of working\nwith a living document that this essay will treat The Fall.\n\nThe event that this essay focuses on is foreshadowed by this passage.\n\n“But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not\neat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely\ndie” (King James Version, Gen. 2.17).\n\nOf course, Adam and Eve do eat from the Tree of Knowledge.  It is the\nconsequences of that action that propels this naturalistic\ninterpretation.  Let us address some cherry-picked consequences in\nturn. \nChild Birth\nGod punishes women with difficult child birth.\n\n“Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy\nconception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children” (Gen. 3.16).\n\nInterpreting this from a biological perspective, the capacity to\nacquire knowledge relates to human brain size.  Human brains increased\nin size dramatically compared with their closest evolutionary kin,\ntheir skulls increasing in size too.  The most obvious obstacle to\never increasing brain and skull size for a baby is its mother’s\npelvis.  For a quadrupedal animal, this might be an easier burden to\nbear, but human pelvises had only recently been shaped for bipedalism,\nan awkward arrangement to deliver big-headed babies.  This made child\nbirth more difficult for women.  Big skulls may account for the\nsuffering that women undergo during child birth.  Difficult child\nbirth is a consequence of big-brained babies, and big brains are a\nprerequisite for general knowledge.\nDeath\n\nGod punishes both man and woman for their disobedience with death.\n\n“In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto\nthe ground; … for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return”\n(Gen. 3.19).\n\nTraditionally, this is interpeted as an entirely bad outcome. However,\nconsider what death is to an animal of limited faculties.  Without\nforesight, does death rightly exist?  Animals die certainly, but what\nis to say that death exists from an animal’s perspective?  From the\nanimal’s perspective death may not exist at all.  Animals may feel\nfear and vigorously avoid things that lead to death, but that does not\nmean they comprehend it anymore than they understand that sex leads to\noffspring.  They do it because it works; understanding is not\nnecessary.  Death only becomes appreciable in a creature with\nforesight.  If knowledge grants one insights into what the future\nholds, then one must come to grips with their own mortality and death.\nDeath is a necessary consequence of knowledge and foresight, not an\nincidental punishment.\nParadise Lost\n\nThe breaking of God’s commandment is seen as Man’s Fall from Grace.\nTraditionally, it has a very negative connotation: Man brought sin\ninto the world.  Man was cast out of the Garden of Eden, a paradise on\nEarth.  Consider it instead as the introduction of morality into the\nworld—including both sin and virtue.  Prior to that, there were only\nanimals.  Animals are not moral agents.  Animals kill one another and\neven humans, but we do not call them murderers.  Their actions are\namoral.  Genesis introduces an agent that makes a transition from an\namoral world to a moral one.  Prior to eating from the Tree of\nKnowledge, Adam and Eve were amoral.  They could not divine right from\nwrong, so they could not have rightly understood disobeying God was\nwrong.  In that sense their transition from amoral to moral cannot be\nwrong—that would mischaracterize the act as a moral act; it would be\nlike calling a lion a murderer for killing a gazelle.  Man does not\nintroduce sin alone into the world; Man introduces morality into the\nworld which includes both sin and virtue.\nHumanity Gained\nThe traditional interpretation of the Fall has not let the preceding\npoint go unnoticed since Eve is blamed more so than Adam.  For if Eve\ncould not tell right from wrong prior to eating from the Tree of\nKnowledge, she could certainly tell afterward.  Thus, by Eve offering\nAdam fruit from the Tree of Knowledge, she knowingly abetted Adam’s\ndisobedience of God’s commandment.  However, consider again what it\nwould mean for Eve to leave Adam as an amoral animal.  The Garden of\nEden is not a paradise hidden away from humanity; the amoral animal\nkingdom is the ever present Garden of Eden, but one we are forbidden\nfrom entering lest we become animals once more.  One could recreate\nthe Garden of Eden on any remote island.  One need only release a\nhuman child with no language, no knowledge, no companionship, but\nplenty of food—but such an act would be monstrous.  If one happened\nupon a child placed in such a condition who grew to be a man, would it\nnot also be monstrous to leave them in that state?  Eve apparently\nthought so.  Morality forces one to wrestle with more than just the\nwill to obey; it forces one to discern good and evil to the best of\none’s ability and challenges one to act accordingly.\nThe Tree of Life\nThere are two trees named in the Garden of Eden.  Each tree can be\ntied directly to a scientific idea.  The Tree of Life is introduced in\nGenesis as God dealt with Man’s trespass.\n\n“And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to\nknow good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take\nalso of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever” (Gen. 3.22).\n\nFour and half billion years ago, the Earth was radically altered by\nthe introduction of something new—a replicator, a gene.  Perhaps it\nwas a primitive RNA.  That replicator evolved and eventually spawned\nall the diversity of life.  Darwin envisioned life as a tree with its\ndescendants branching away from the root.  Are genes the Tree of Life\nfrom Genesis?  Genes do seem to hold the secrets to life and death.\nIf one understood genes completely such that he or she could reshape\nthem, could death be eradicated?  Possibly.  Researchers like Aubrey\nde Grey insist this is a viable idea (Hooper 1).\n\n\n“So he [God] drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the\ngarden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way,\nto keep the way of the tree of life” (Gen. 3.24).\n\nIf it is only our ignorance of genes that prohibits us from picking\nthe fruits of the Tree of Life, then the staggering complexity of our\ngenes becomes the protector of the Tree of Life.\nThe Tree of Knowledge\nThe Tree of Knowledge of good and evil that Adam and Eve ate from also\nhas its own scientific representative.  With the introduction of\nhumans on Earth, a new replicator has been released and it too is\nproducing radical effects—the meme.  It is crudely analogous to a\ngene as the cultural unit of selection.  Instead of memes trying to\nreplicate themselves in bodies as genes do, memes replicate themselves\nin brains (Blackmore 37).  A catchy tune that is hard to get out of\none’s head, that is a meme.  A chain letter that orders one to\nreplicate it for dubious rewards; it is a meme.  The ten commandments,\nthose are memes.  What is not a meme?  An experience is not a meme.\nAn idea that is never communicated is not a meme.  In the same way\nthat the Tree of Life fans out with variation and is trimmed by\nnatural selection, memes branch out with great variety, dying out\nessentially when no minds or artifacts serve as their hosts.  This\ntree of ideas, of memes, is the Tree of Knowledge not only of good and\nevil but of all human knowledge.\nConclusion\nGenesis is an ancient story.  From the difficulty of child labor, to\nfacing death, to the enduring struggle to discern good from evil, its\nimagery does not lose its potency by marrying it with science; nay, it\nis enriched.  The Fall captures the transcendent issues of morality\nand mortality.  It is a part of humanity’s heritage.  It was crafted\nby many hands during humanity’s cultural evolution.  It grew up with\nus, and we are challenged to allow it to grow further still.  Genesis\nhas the capacity to grow as this essay has shown.  Many of the seminal\nevents in Genesis have an interpretation that unites the poetry of our\npast with the science of our present.  In Genesis humans claimed the\nTree of Knowledge, and the creation of ideas, or memetic engineering,\nhas been our domain while the Tree of Life and its secrets have\nremained out of reach.  The creation of new life, genetic engineering,\nis emerging however.  It will doubtlessly change the way we live and\ndie.  We may be on the brink of entering an age where we move beyond\nthe flaming sword and claim the Tree of Life for ourselves.\n\nWorks Cited\nBlackmore, Susan.  The Meme Machine.

Emacsy is an embeddable Emacs-like library for\nGNU Guile Scheme. It’s an\nattempt to extract “the Emacs way” of using, augmenting, and extending\nan application while it is running. Emacsy harbors no ambition to\nbecome a text editor because there is already a great Emacsy text\neditor: Emacs.  I’d like to use this post to address some features and\nimplementation details that I’m personally excited about: how to do\nonline help, going beyond Emacs to do job control, and some comments\non whether Emacsy’s “shell” ought to be special.\nThe GSoC proposal has many\ndetails\nabout the project, but perhaps I should say who this blog entry is\nwritten for, as I see a handful distinct audiences: application users,\nintegrators, and contributors.\n\n\nApplication users are the users of some application X that Emacsy\nhas been integrated into it.  As Emacsy hasn’t been released, there\nis no real application users to speak of yet, but they’re important\nto keep in mind.\n\n\nIntegrators are developers who embed Emacsy into their own\napplication.  They need to know enough to integrate with it but\ndon’t necessarily care about how Emacsy does its thing.\n\n\nContributors are developers who are interested in the architecture\nand inner-workings of Emacsy and can contribute to its development.\n\n\nThese Emacsy blog posts will be of most interest to would-be contributors and\nintegrators, and I will assume some familiarity with Emacs.  There’s a\ntension between features that might be nice to have but would incur a\nlarge burden on integrators.  It’ll be helpful to keep that tension in\nmind when deciding what features to implement and how.\nHelp will always be given in Emacsy to those who ask for it\nEmacs has the most comprehensive online help system of any\napplication; there is really nothing else like it. This is the reason\nfor its claim to be\nself-documenting.\nUnfortunately because there isn’t anything else like it, it seems a\nbit alien at first.  If you don’t know what the key sequence M-C-\\\ndoes, then hit C-h k M-C-\\ and Emacs will tell you that it’s bound\nto the procedure\nindent-region.\n(If this notation C-h for control-h is unfamiliar, please see Sacha\nChua’s excellent one pager for\nbeginners.)\nIf you don’t know what the procedure indent-region does, then hit\nC-h f indent-region and Emacs will describe it and even provide a\nlink to the source code.  One question I’ve been struggling with is,\nhow can Emacsy provide online help like Emacs does? Several ideas come\nto mind:\n\n\nText buffer, duh. One idea is to duplicate the way Emacs does it\nby showing a read only text buffer. In Emacs all things are text\nbuffers, but Emacsy does not make this presumption. Also if one must\ndisplay a text buffer that means every integrator must figure out\nhow to display this text. What if the view is larger than the\nwindow? Scrollbar, please. What if there are links in the text?\nShould they be clickable? Of course! Integrator, please implement\nthese text features that may have nothing to do with your\napplication.  This seems like too high a burden for integrators,\neven if it would be cool.\n\n\nMinibuffer to the max. Just use the minibuffer for\neverything. We can get away with using the minibuffer for a lot of\nthings but that would not allow us to have a comprehensive online\nhelp system that was comparable to Emacs’.\n\n\nUse the Web, Luke. This idea struck me recently. What if when we\nwanted to show a lot of information, say about some particular\nfunction C-h f some-fun, we opened a link to some internal web\nserver? Emacsy serves up the information over HTTP and the browser\ngives us a lot of features like links, styling, rich media, and\nperhaps some customization possibilities. The implementor only needs\nto send URL requests to some handler application.  Fancier\nimplementors could handle these URLs internally in a web view.\n\n\nI’m pretty taken with this last idea.  It retains the ability to let\nthe application be fully self-documenting without imposing a heavy\nburden on the implementor.\nGoing Beyond Emacs: Job Control\nOne feature I’m particularly excited about is job control. How many\ntimes have you accidentally stumbled upon some network operation that\ncauses Emacs to freeze? Granted it’ll come back if you wait, or you\ncan quit C-g it. But wouldn’t it be nice to just suspend that\ncommand like you would in the shell?  Just hit C-z to suspend\nit. Then maybe type M-x background to continue running it in the\nbackground. That’s a feature that we can implement in Emacsy, but how?\nAllowing for job control brings up the issue of multitasking.\nMultitask like it’s 1999\nHow shall Emacsy support running multiple jobs some of which are in\nthe background?  I’m going to suggest a cooperative\nmultitasking\napproach rather than a pre-emptive\nmultitasking\napproach.  Heresy, I know, and I know it’s not the ’90s, but hear me\nout.\nI like to think of Emacsy as inheriting from both Emacs and Unix.\nUnix and Emacs are somewhat odd bedfellows though. Unix is about small\ntools that do one thing well and compose easily; the shared state is\nthe filesystem with little context, and it’s generally not focused on\ninteractive apps. Emacs on the other hand is about having all tools,\nbig and small, at one’s finger tips (key bindings); the shared state\nis Emacs’ process memory with lots of context, and it’s focused on\ninteractive use.\nFor an operating system like Unix pre-emptive multitasking is\nabsolutely preferred.  Note though that the memory of each process is\nisolated from one another, so you don’t have to worry about one\nprocess overwriting another’s memory.  However, an Emacsy command will\nnot have its memory isolated from other commands, so it seems\ninadvisable to use a pre-emptive multitasking mechanism like threads\nsince the commands could then overwrite shared memory unless very\ncarefully synchronized. Instead I suggest using coroutines to\nimplement a cooperative multitasking system.  Only one piece of Emacsy\ncode runs at any one time; thus a whole class of race conditions\nevaporate.  This doesn’t preclude one from using threads within Emacsy\nsince threads are natively supported by GNU Guile, but they will have\nto work out the synchronization details themselves.\nWhy not vimy?\nThere are two text editors of note: Emacs and vim, so why Emacsy and\nnot vimy?  Partly because I couldn’t do a vimy project justice because\nI’m not a vim user, but I think there is a larger reason than that. I\nthink vim is an excellent text editor. Some of my friends are absolute\nwizards with it. I’ve had glimers of understanding the power and\nunity of its terse\nsub-language. I\nam envious of the dot . command. However, making the best text\neditor, sub-language and all, does not necessarily mean it would\ntransfer well to other domains. Is an insert mode necessary in a CAD\nprogram?  What is the terse sub-language of manipulating chemical\nmodels? I think making something worthy of the name vimy would be very\nchallenging in another domain.\nThat said, I don’t see any reason why someone couldn’t write a\nvim-like UI using Emacsy as a starting place.  Borrowing more from the\nUnix tradition, consider the shell.  The creators of Unix didn’t make\nthe shell special.  It is just another program unlike DOS’ shell, but\nthat required a lot of ingenuity to invent the right six system calls\nto make that happen (Torvalds, “Just for Fun”\n54).\nIn my\nproposal,\nI emphasized the Key-Lookup-Execute-Command-Loop (KLECL), but in a way\nthat is essentially Emacs’ shell.  One could write a different shell,\na vim-like shell if they preferred.  That is, if Emacsy takes care to\nnot make the shell special.\nThat’s it for now\nThose are some of my current musings for Emacsy.  I’m going to try to\nrecord further ideas on Emacsy’s github\nwiki.  Feel free to\ncontribute your own ideas there or write a comment below.  Otherwise,\nI’ll be on twitter or hanging out in\n#guile on freenode.net.\n","id":"https://shanecelis.github.io/posts/google-summer-of-code-2013-emacsy/","title":"Google Summer of Code 2013: Emacsy"},"https://shanecelis.github.io/posts/object-oriented-rust-yuck-and-yet/":{"body":"Introduction\nI remember a coworker, gosh, maybe two decades ago, telling me you can\nwrite object oriented code in any language—even C. We were happily\nwriting Java at the time (see, a long time ago), and I was confused\nbecause obviously the C language does not natively support object\noriented programming but he was\nright.\nMany people have written object oriented code in C. For instance\nGTK uses the GObject\nlibrary.\nNethack is another example. So object\noriented programming can be done in C but the language does not\nexplicitly facilitate it. Rust is another language that has questionable\nsupport for conventional object oriented programming. Suppose we want\nconventional object oriented support, they can’t stop us from doing\nobject oriented programming if that’s what we’re determined to do.\nObject Oriented Programming\n\nWhat is object oriented programming? Gosh, it’s been with us so long\nit’s hard to think of what it actually means.\n\nA class defines some data and provides methods.\n\nstruct Mouse { // a \"class\"\n  age: u8 // an unsigned 8-bit, \n          // a byte, or a \"datum\"\n}\n\nimpl Mouse {\n  fn is_old(&amp;self) -&gt; bool { // a \"method\"\n    self.age &gt;= 2\n  }\n}\n\n\nAn object is an instance of a class, of which there can be many.\n\nlet mouse = Mouse { age: 1 }; // an \"object\"\n\n\nEncapsulation: The data a class defines may be private and its\npublic methods constitute its programmatic interface.\n\npub struct Rat {\n  age: u8 // Field is not public so Rat \n          // can't be constructed and age \n          // can't be accessed externally.\n}\n\nimpl Rat {\n  pub fn new(years_old: u8) -&gt; Rat { // a \"static method\"\n    return Rat { age: years_old };\n  }\n\n  pub fn is_old(&amp;self) -&gt; bool { // an \"instance method\"\n    self.age &gt;= 3\n  }\n}\n\nlet rat = Rat::new(3);\n\n\nAbstraction: A caller—that can interact with a class—can also\ninteract with any of its subclasses. Likewise a caller—that can\ninteract with an interface—can interact with any of its\nimplementers.\n\npub trait Old { // an \"interface\"\n  fn is_old(&amp;self) -&gt; bool;\n}\n\n\nInheritance: One can extend a class adding new data and modifying\nits methods.\n\nWe’ll come back to this one. The short answer is that rust does not\nsupport implementation inheritance natively: structs cannot inherit from\none another. But a trait can inherit from other traits.\nPolymorphism\nWhat is polymorphism? Polymorphism is the ability to access objects of\ndifferent types through the same programmatic interface. There is\nsubclass polymorphism: a child class can be substituted anywhere that\naccepts its parent. There is interface polymorphism: a class that\nimplements an interface can be substituted anywhere that accepts that\ninterface.\nFurthermore there are two variants of polymorphism: static and dynamic.\nWith dynamic polymorphism a caller does not need to know the class yet\nit can still interact via its interface. Dynamic polymorphism is\ntraditionally implemented with a virtual method table that each class\nand subclass maintains. This introduces some overhead in space and time:\nthere’s an lookup for a virtual method call. This is called dynamic\ndispatch.\nThen there is static polymorphism, where code can be written to work\nsome interface but the compiler knows what class is given and omits the\ndynamic dispatch and calls the class’s method directly. This is called\nstatic dispatch.\nA Model Animal\nRust’s traits are analogous to C# or Java’s interfaces. Let’s create the\ncanonical object oriented animal example.\ntrait Animal {\n  fn cry();\n  fn sleep();\n  fn roam();\n}\n\nIt crys, sleeps, and roams. What more could you ask for?\nA Cat\nLet’s make a Cat “class” to implement it. Rust calls it a struct.\nstruct Cat { }\n\n\nimpl Animal for Cat {\n  fn cry() {\n    println!(\"meow\");\n  }\n  fn sleep() {\n    println!(\"Zzzz\");\n  }\n  fn roam() {\n    println!(\"patter patter pounce\");\n  }\n}\n\nRun it\nWe can exercise it like so.\nCat::cry();\n\nmeow\n\n\n\n\nHowever, this cry() is akin to a static method in Java or C#\nterminology. There is no instance or object it is called on. Static\nmethods aren’t capable of any dynamic polymorphism. These self-less\nfunctions are called associated\nfunctions in rust terminology.\nStatic Polymorphism\nHowever, rust can do static polymorphism. Say we had another “class”\ncalled Bird.\nstruct Bird {}\n\nimpl Animal for Bird {\n  fn cry() {\n    println!(\"chirp\");\n  }\n  fn sleep() {\n    println!(\"Zzzz\");\n  }\n  fn roam() {\n    println!(\"flit flit flurp\");\n  }\n}\n\nWe can of couse make calls on the class like so.\nBird::roam();\n\nflit flit flurp\n\nBut we can also use rust’s generics to write code that will handle any\nAnimal struct without requiring an instance.\nfn cry_to_sleep&lt;T: Animal&gt;() {\n  T::cry();\n  T::cry();\n  T::sleep();\n}\n\nNow we can exercise it. You might think we’d do call_me_sleepy&lt;Cat&gt;()\nbut rust instead uses cry_to_sleep::&lt;Cat&gt;(). They call the ::&lt;Type&gt;\na turbo fish. I don’t know why. Does it ::&lt;&gt; look like a fish? Maybe\nI can see it now.\ncry_to_sleep::&lt;Cat&gt;();\n\nmeow\nmeow\nZzzz\n\ncry_to_sleep::&lt;Bird&gt;();\n\nchirp\nchirp\nZzzz\n\nI think this is pretty cool. It was only recently that C# got interface\nstatic\nmethods,\nand you can use them to do all kinds of cool things like make generics\nwork seamlessly with math operators in C#. And you can use it to good\neffect.\nFactories. Factories everywhere.\nRemember how everyone needed a factory class in addition to their class?\nWhy did they need a factory? Because new is not dynamically\ndispatched; new only operates on a concrete class. You can’t new an\ninterface. So to workaround that we added an indirection, a whole other\nclass we call a factory, which is really just a glorified constructor, a\ndynamically dispatched constructor.\nYou’d think one could have added a static method to their class like\nthis:\nclass Gorilla {\n  public static Gorilla New() { ... }\n}\n\nvar gorilla = Gorilla.New();\n\nBut one could not substitute a Gorilla class with some other Gorilla\nclass. You can substitute an instance of the Gorilla class with any of\nits descendant instances but not the class itself. There’s only one\nGorilla class.\nA New Way\nWith static polymorphism you could instead write this:\ntrait Factory {\n  fn new() -&gt; Self; // \"new\" is not a keyword in rust.\n                    // It's not special.\n}\n\nstruct Gorilla { }\n\nimpl Factory for Gorilla {\n  fn new() -&gt; Self { // \"Self\" is an alias for the implementing type.\n    println!(\"Made a gorilla\");\n    return Gorilla { }; // This is a \"struct constructor.\"\n  }\n}\n\nfn gorilla_keeper&lt;F: Factory&gt;() {\n  let gorilla1 = F::new();\n  let gorilla2 = F::new();\n}\n\ngorilla_keeper::&lt;Gorilla&gt;();\n\nMade a gorilla\nMade a gorilla\n\nThen you could make a class responsible for making instances of itself\nwithout a factory class, and you could substitute other classes that\nwere their own factory too.\nstruct MockGorilla {}\n\nimpl Factory for MockGorilla {\n  fn new() -&gt; MockGorilla {\n    println!(\"Made a mock gorilla\");\n    MockGorilla { } // Can omit 'return' and ';' to \n                    // return last expression.\n  }\n}\n\ngorilla_keeper::&lt;MockGorilla&gt;();\n\nMade a mock gorilla\nMade a mock gorilla\n\nThis static polymorphism is limited however: the type must be known at\ncompile time so the compiler can emit code for a concrete function that\nuses that type. So we are trading space for time when we use generics in\nthis way. Our binary size is larger but our performance is better. But\nwe can’t use this on types that weren’t present at compile-time. Here’s\na fun new word: this is called\nmonomorphization.\nTake Two\nWhat we’d like instead is to call these functions on an instance of an\nobject. To do that in rust, we add the &amp;self parameter to our trait.\ntrait Animal {\n  fn cry(&amp;self);\n  fn sleep(&amp;self);\n  fn roam(&amp;self);\n}\n\nNow they’re instance methods.\nstruct Cat { }\n\nimpl Animal for Cat {\n  fn cry(&amp;self) {\n    println!(\"meow\");\n  }\n  fn sleep(&amp;self) {\n    println!(\"Zzzz\");\n  }\n  fn roam(&amp;self) {\n    println!(\"patter patter pounce\");\n  }\n}\n\nNow let’s try and run it.\nlet cat = Cat {};\ncat.cry();\n\nmeow\n\nIt does what we expect. But it does not offer any subclass polymorphism.\nThere’s no means to inherit Cat’s behavior.\nNo Subtype Polymorphism Unless…\n\nIf we want subtype polymorphism, we’re going to have to implement it\nourselves. Our trait probably needs to know the base type. We can make\nour trait Animal generic with respect to a Base type that is some\nother kind of Animal like so:\ntrait Animal {\n  type Base : Animal;\n  fn cry(&amp;self);\n  // ...\n}\n\nAnd we can also define default implementations of trait functions. That\nseems like a good place to put our dynamic dispatcher functionality,\ndoesn’t it? But we need to be able to get an instance of the base\n“class” or struct, so we’ll add a self.base() function.\ntrait Animal {\n  type Base : Animal;\n  fn base(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;Self::Base;\n  fn cry(&amp;self) {\n    self.base().cry();\n  }\n  fn sleep(&amp;self) {\n    self.base().sleep();\n  }\n  fn roam(&amp;self) {\n    self.base().roam();\n  }\n}\n\nNow we can implement only part of Animal for Cat.\nstruct Cat {}\n\nimpl Animal for Cat {\n  type Base = Cat;\n  fn base(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;Cat {\n    &amp;Cat {} // My base type is... myself?\n  }\n  fn cry(&amp;self) {\n    println!(\"meow\");\n  }\n}\n\nIf we call cry(), it works.\nlet cat = Cat {};\ncat.cry();\n\nmeow\n\nBut calling the unimplemented roam() will cause a stack overflow.\nlet cat = Cat {};\ncat.roam();\n\n\nthread 'main' has overflowed its stack\nfatal runtime error: stack overflow\n\nThe reason that happens is because we infinitely recurse down the base\ntype. We call self.base().base().base()... when there’s no default\nimplementation. We can define a base type that implements all the\nfunctions to prevent infinite recursion.\nBase Animal type\nWe can rectify that problem by defining a base animal type that\nimplements all the functions. This is the base case for our recursive\ndynamic dispatcher.\nstruct BaseAnimal {}\n\nimpl Animal for BaseAnimal {\n  type Base = BaseAnimal;\n  fn base(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;BaseAnimal {\n    panic!(\"Never call me here.\");\n  }\n  fn cry(&amp;self) { \n    println!(\"base cry\");\n  }\n  fn sleep(&amp;self) { \n    println!(\"base sleep\");\n  }\n  fn roam(&amp;self) { \n    println!(\"base roam\");\n  }\n}\n\nstruct Cat {}\n\nimpl Animal for Cat {\n  type Base = BaseAnimal;\n  fn base(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;BaseAnimal {\n    &amp;BaseAnimal {}\n  }\n  fn cry(&amp;self) {\n    println!(\"meow\");\n  }\n}\n\nNow we can call roam() and we won’t get an infinite loop.\nlet cat = Cat {};\ncat.roam();\n\nbase roam\n\nAn Optional Base Type\nInstead of requiring a base struct for every object oriented trait, we\ncould change our base() signature to use an Option&lt;&gt;.\ntrait Animal {\n  type Base : Animal;\n  fn base(&amp;self) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;Self::Base&gt; {\n    None\n  }\n  fn cry(&amp;self) {\n    if let Some(b) = self.base() {\n      b.cry();\n    } else {\n      todo!(\"Not yet implemented\");\n    }\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n\nHow to Extend the Class’s API?\nOne further issue is what happens when a trait is extended? This happens\nall the time with object oriented code. A subclass adds fields and new\npublic methods. Adding fields is easy in this setup:\nBat {\n  speed: f32,\n  base_obj: Rat\n}\n\nAdding public “methods” that also do subtype polymorphism is less clear.\ntrait EndangeredAnimal : Animal {\n  fn is_endangered(&amp;self) -&gt; bool;\n}\n\nI’m going to leave this as an exercise for the reader partly because I\nthink it’s going to be a mess but it is doable.\nHow do Crustaceans Actually do This?\nLet’s go back to our second version of this trait.\ntrait Animal {\n  fn cry(&amp;self);\n  fn sleep(&amp;self);\n  fn roam(&amp;self);\n}\n\nstruct Cat {} \n\nimpl Animal for Cat {\n  fn cry(&amp;self) {\n    println!(\"meow\");\n  }\n  fn sleep(&amp;self) {\n    println!(\"Zzzz\");\n  }\n  fn roam(&amp;self) {\n    println!(\"patter patter pounce\");\n  }\n}\n\nstruct Bird {} \n\nimpl Animal for Bird {\n  fn cry(&amp;self) {\n    println!(\"chirp\");\n  }\n  fn sleep(&amp;self) {\n    println!(\"Zzzz\");\n  }\n  fn roam(&amp;self) {\n    println!(\"flit flit flurp\");\n  }\n}\n\nWe’ve got two struct and we can use generics to call whichever\nimplementation is present.\nfn cry_to_sleep&lt;T: Animal&gt;(animal: T) {\n  animal.cry();\n  animal.cry();\n  animal.sleep();\n}\n\nlet cat = Cat {};\ncry_to_sleep(cat);\n\nmeow\nmeow\nZzzz\n\nBut what if I don’t know the type exactly?\nSuppose you have a heterogenous list of Animals and you don’t know\ntheir exact type any more. How do you deal with that? You can’t use the\ngeneric solution.\nOk, here’s the really cool thing that rust does.\nfn cry_to_sleep_dynamic(animal: &amp;dyn Animal) {\n  animal.cry();\n  animal.cry();\n  animal.sleep();\n}\n\nRather than having a structural cost baked into every object that is\ncapable of polymorphism with a virtual function look up, rust has\nvirtual function look up on demand via its dyn keyword. When you use\ndyn you’re passing and receiving a “fat” pointer, which is two\npointers: one to the regular struct, and another to a virtual function\nlook up table.\nSo you can call this method on bird\nlet bird = Bird {};\ncry_to_sleep_dynamic(&amp;bird);\n\nchirp\nchirp\nZzzz\n\nor on cat.\nlet cat = Cat {};\ncry_to_sleep_dynamic(&amp;cat);\n\nmeow\nmeow\nZzzz\n\nSo you can have dynamic polymorphism in rust whenever and with whatever\ntrait you like, but the funny thing is if one has a choice between\ndirect static dispatch or an indirect dynamic dispatch, one often\nprefers static dispatch.\n\nStatic dispatch is known at compile time. It’s faster. It’s simpler to\nreason about. Use it if you can. I have found that when dynamic dispatch\nis available on a per call instead of a per class basis, it’s amazing\nhow little I actually use it. But dynamic dispatch is there for whatever\ntrait1 you need it on and you don’t have to rely on the original\nauthor knowing which methods you really needed to be marked “virtual”.\nAcknowledgments\nThanks to CandyCorvid and kohugaly at r/rust for their input on this\narticle’s\nthread.\n1\nTurns out only certain traits can use dyn; only traits that are\nobject\nsafe:\nroughly no generics, no constants, and accepts a &amp;self,\n&amp;mut self, Box\\&lt;Self\\&gt;, or other smart pointer to self.\n\n","id":"https://shanecelis.github.io/posts/object-oriented-rust-yuck-and-yet/","title":"Object Oriented Programming in Rust—Yuck and Yet..."},"https://shanecelis.github.io/posts/the-garden/":{"body":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource files available on github.\n","id":"https://shanecelis.github.io/posts/the-garden/","title":"The Garden v 2.0: A Parable Inspired by the Church of Emacs"},"https://shanecelis.github.io/posts/why-im-trying-literate-programming/":{"body":"I decided to experiment with literate programming recently because I\nfelt like something must be wrong with this story: A colleague and I\nbegan a research project using MATLAB for a class.  We both started\nwith about the same amount of MATLAB experience: close to nil.  We\nboth started at the ground floor of development.  There was no legacy\ncode to speak of, and again there was only two of us.  We spec’d out\nmost of the simulation as a LaTeX document that clearly described the\nsimulation mathematically based on a reference implementation.  In my\nmind, there isn’t a better scenario for collaboration. However, late\ninto the project, my colleague was getting shut out of participating\nin development.  What shut my colleague out?\nLet me be clear, my colleague was willing, smart, and hard-working.\nJust the kind of person one hopes to be working with, yet the project\nhad grown into a labyrinth that only I knew how to navigate.  Without\nme on hand to help navigate the growing code base, his efforts seemed\nstymied.  I will be the first to admit that the code, and in\nparticular my code, was not stellar—it was written to meet a\ndeadline and both of us were green when it came to MATLAB.  However,\nthis wasn’t a large project, but it did grow rapidly.  Below is a\ngraph of the total commits as shown in github.  (The repository I’m\nshowing is not public unfortunately.)\n\nMy expectation was that having two people developing one code base\nfrom the beginning with equivalent experience should be a recipe for\nsuccess.  That did not turn out to be the case.  Although the project\ndid not fail outright, we ran our experiments, produced results,\nand should ultimately get a publication out of it.  However, judging\nit on the basis of enabling collaboration, it was a failure with what\nare some of the best starting conditions possible.  Just think how\nmuch worse a project will fare when one’s working on a code base with\nn contributors; each contributor joining at a different time with a\ndiffering amount of experience with the language, domain, and tools;\nand on a code base with a longer history and its own legacy issues?\nOne glimmer of how things could be different was provided by the spec\nwe wrote before beginning the implementation.\nWe had written up a spec that described the dynamics of the simulation\nas mathematical relationships.  Everything we wanted the simulation to\ndo was clear and easily inspectable.  As we wrote the implementation,\nhowever, what was clear became obscure.  “What does this section of\ncode do?”  If one compared the code with the spec and squinted one\ncould start to piece together how the implementation fulfilled the\nspec.  But this connection was fleeting.  One had to compare between\nthe spec and the code, make the connection, then enjoy the\nenlightenment before forgetting it.  As the code base became the ground\ntruth going beyond the spec, the utility of the spec was crippled,\ne.g., “Was the spec updated since we decided to do Y instead of X?”\nOf course it hasn’t.  I’ve been too busy implementing Y.\nIn fact the spec ended up being a kind of reverse-engineered literate\nprogram.  We used a reference implementation to draw out the details\nof what the original simulation was actually doing.  In it, we had\nsections of code that we decoded into mathematical relationships.  It\nis kind of amazing how much some code can be compressed when\ndescribing it mathematically.  We could examine the code and math\ndirectly, changing that connection from fleeting into something\nlasting.  Given this reverse-engineered literate program, we then\nenthusiastically went and re-encoded the math into code again and\nlost that connection and scrutability.\nAll I’ve said about literate programming so far is that it had math\nand code in one document.  I think of literate programming as\ninverting the relationship between comments and code.  In normal\nprogramming, comments are superfluous, thrown out, and don’t matter to\nthe compiler.  The code comes first and foremost and if you’re lucky,\nmaybe there are some comments to lead you astray.  In a literate\nprogram, one begins by writing a document for someone to read.  Within\nthe document, one specifies sections of code in whatever order he or\nshe feel is best for the reader.  Here is an example literate\nprogram and its\nliterate source\ncode; it uses\nthe literate programming tool noweb.\nI wrote those for the Emacsy project which I proposed as a Google Summer of\nCode\nproject.\nAn experiment that I would love to have tried is to take that spec,\nchuck out the reference implementation sections of code, and write the\nimplementation as a truly literate program.  I didn’t have enough\nexperience with literate programming at the time to think of it, but\neven today the thought of encouraging someone to collaborate on a\nliterate program seems like a hard sell, e.g., “Do you like to code?\nGreat. Do you like to write? Awesome. Do you like math? No. Well, two out of\nthree is WAY better than average.”  But I am finding a lot of\nadvantages to literate programming.\nAdvantages\nA picture is worth a thousand ASCII pictures. A big advantage of\nliterate programming is being able to include graphics.  I had a\nproblem recently where I was implementing a simple 2D ray cast.  I\nsketched it out on Paper 53,\nlabeled my variables, then baked that drawing right into the document.\nUsually, that connection—What does this code actually mean?  What\ndoes it represent?—would have been fleeting.  I would have made a\nsketch on graph paper, written the code, inevitably lost or trashed\nthe sketch.  Suppose I find a bug in my code months later.  How am I\ngoing to figure it out?  Well, I’ll probably try to reverse-engineer\nmy sketch.  Why do I do this to myself and everyone that has to\nmaintain this code after me!?  With literate programming I made that\nconnection of what does this code mean into something lasting, and\nit’s not in a separate document that will be forgotten, unloved, and\nsuperseded because it’s the ground truth: it’s the source of the\nsource.\n\nYou can read it like a book. Another thing I didn’t appreciate\ninitially is that a literate program provides an unambiguous place to\nstart with an unfamiliar code base and a direction to go.  Literate\nprogramming linearizes a code base.  More than that it linearizes the\ncode to be understandable—not compilable.  Imagine if books weren’t\narranged in a linear fashion.  Instead of starting at page one, expert\nreaders suggest, “I like to start on page 34 work backwards, then jump\nto page 62.”  Normally when I’ve decided I want to alter an existing\ncode base, first I have to acquaint myself with it. I dive into\nwhatever looks most promising: README, HACKING, main.c, or project.h.\nI look at those by convention, but the meat of the project that I want\nto alter could be anywhere in that file tree, and it may not be\ndocumented at all. I search, grep, and basically bumble around until I\nfind the spots I need to edit. A literate program is a topological\nordering of that\nfile tree, ordered to make it easier to understand.\n\nThe comfort of plaintext, the richness of PDF. It is kind of\namazing how low-tech coding is.  If it’s not plaintext, then it will\nget corrupted and destroy your weekend.  This is partly why I can’t\ntake fully to Mathematica, which does allow for a rich, graphical\nprogramming and documentation language.  Plaintext is comforting.  In\na world of inscrutable binary formats, plaintext stands out as being\nreadily inspectable, wholly knowable, effortlessly editable.  Most of\nthe literate programming tools use LaTeX as their documentation\nlanguage because Knuth, who started it all, did.  And it is comforting\nthat my documentation and code is in plaintext, can be checked in to\ngit and diff’d, but that doesn’t prevent me from using a richer medium\nto better describe what my program does, should do, and can inspire\nothers to do.\nDisadvantages\nLaTeX raises the barrier to entry. If a literate program has a\nmathematical bent, then using LaTeX as the documentation language is a\nblessing.  But LaTeX is a tricky tool and it raises the barrier to\nentry considerably for would-be collaborators.  If I wanted to write a\nliterate program that was not math heavy, I’d prefer using Markdown as\nthe documentation language.  The first literate program tool was\nWEB, and it dictated the\nprogramming language, a dialect of pascal, and the documentation\nlanguage, LaTeX.  Many tools that followed were programming language\nneutral, but the documentation language has not been allowed the same\nfreedom.  I think the programmer should be able to select both\nlanguages.  The Docco project\nuses plain old Markdown as its documentation language.  Its simplicity\nis inspiring.  The downsides are that one may not reorder code to ease\nits explanation; the code must be in the order the compiler expects;\nand its one code file per Markdown file.\nTool support is lacking. Literate programming is not mainstream, so\nthe tool support is sometimes lacking.  For instance, #line compiler\ndirectives are a necessity.  If compiler errors direct you to the\ngenerated source code rather than the literate code, forget every\nmildly good thing you’ve ever heard about literate programming; you’ve\nentered hell. I’ve been writing a lot of code in GNU Guile\nScheme and I needed #line\ndirectives, which seems imminently doable using reader macros.\nHowever, it actually did require me to patch Guile in order to do it\nin the general case.  I will write up another post and share that\npatch soon.\nThere are some other disadvantages:\n\n\nIt takes more time. Literate programming does take more time than\njust slapping some code together.\n\n\nMultiple modes in Emacs, ha! I use Emacs, and Emacs does many\nwonderful things, but multiple modes is not one of them.  In a\nnoweb file, multiple syntaxes are nested together and the Emacs\nregex-based syntax highlighter and mode detector are not good\nenough.  I wish Emacs used Parsing Expression\nGrammars (PEGs).\n\n\nWriting raises the barrier to entry. Knuth asks us to not only\nwrite good code but also to write well, and neither of these are\neasy tasks.  Asking for both from every contributor is a tall\norder.\n\n\nConclusion\nI’m not suggesting that literate programming is a silver bullet or the\nbest way to write every program.  I don’t use it for everything.  I’m\nonly using it on programs that I want to encourage collaboration on.\nMy hope is that it will help me avoid the story I outlined at the\nbeginning where collaborators are shut out of participating because\nthe edifice one builds becomes an inscrutable labyrinth; however,\nliterate programming may be a double-edged sword due to it raising the\nbarrier to entry.  I haven’t gotten the chance to see whether literate\nprogramming helps or hurts a project.  My current projects are solo so\nfar, but I am enjoying trying to program literately.
